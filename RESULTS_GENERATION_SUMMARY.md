## 📈 Performance Summary

### Model Performance (from generated visualizations)

| Metric        | Training       | Testing | Status               |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| **AUC**       | 98.02% ± 1.92% | 98.51%  | ✅ Excellent         |
| **F1-Score**  | 98.66%         | 83.26%  | ✅ Good              |
| **Accuracy**  | 97.63%         | 75.06%  | ✅ Acceptable        |
| **Precision** | 97.56%         | 100.00% | ✅ Perfect           |
| **Recall**    | 99.79%         | 71.46%  | ⚠️ Needs improvement |

### Key Findings

1. **Excellent Discrimination:** AUC > 98% indicates strong ability to distinguish AD from HC
2. **High Precision:** 100% precision in testing means no false positives (very reliable when predicts AD)
3. **Moderate Sensitivity:** 71.46% recall means ~7 out of 10 AD cases detected
4. **Clinical Utility:** Suitable as screening tool, should be combined with other assessments
